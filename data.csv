About
Transforming the way cities are planned.
Urban Dashboard’s mission is to become the gold standard of efficient, data-driven planning and urban design. We develop an AI-powered decision support platform for smarter, faster and more effective development processes.
Urban Dashboard streamlines the iterative planning approach, giving planners and urban designers the ability to integrate and take advantage of an abundance of data layers  and spatial analysis while also simplifying and shortening the planning process.
Urban Dashboard allows for data-rich decision making from an early stage, creating value and minimising the chance for errors at the implementation phase. The platform offers various analyses of economic, environmental, and sustainability factors within moments. The platform’s Built Volume Engine generates and optimizes a 3D model of building volumes, according to each specific lot’s attributes The result is efficient design in near real-time experience, with minimum user input.
Urban Dashboard enables seamless collaboration between stakeholders in a development project – local authorities, developers, architects and urban designers, planners, and other stakeholders.

About
In a nutshell, Flytrex is building the world’s first drone based delivery service – cutting delivery costs and times by an order of magnitude in an (almost) infinite market.
In August 2017 Flytrex launched the world’s first fully operational, regulatory approved, on-demand drone delivery service in Reykjavik, Iceland, and became the leading competitor in the race to deploy a true on-demand delivery service via autonomous vehicles. The Flytrex system was approved by ICETRA (Iceland’s Civil Aviation Authority) and insured, and set precedent after being granted approval to operate BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) and above populated regions, in a first world country.
Flytrex was also selected to participate in the FAA’S Drone Pilot Program, partnering with North Carolina’s Department of Transportation and taking on the challenge to establish the first drone based delivery service in the United States.
While the majority of packages that require transit across cities are no heavier than 2lbs, Flytrex drones are able to carry up to 6.5lbs and travel a distance of approximately 6 aerial miles. The drones require minimal handling thus reducing manpower, and ensuring a quick delivery every single time.

About









Innovative technology


I-form aims to develop technological solutions for the full industrialization of the conventional construction process.
Our technology enables advanced construction for projects of any size, for any construction company and any execution contractor, without the need for unique design or the establishment of external plants, and without regulatory and engineering restrictions.


Smart Lost Templates


The advanced molds we have developed make the entire construction process, from the “execution planning” stage to the wet finishing stage. We provide packages that meet all the constructive and architectural requirements in the project. In addition to the templates adapted to the project, the package includes special cladding boards and screws for attaching them












Accurate planning


Our software analyzes the construction plans and breaks down the structure into pre-assembled parts, and then, to connect to the “thorns” of the floor. The smart templates allow for precise design through which we provide a “custom suit” for each project.


Promoting innovation in the construction industry


The great competition and the uncertainty about profitability, lead the position holders in the industry to short-term thinking and conservatism.
By increasing the profit for contractors and developers, while lowering the total cost of the project, we can ensure certainty and thus increase the adoption of innovative technologies.

About
Foldstruct is a new way of thinking about construction. Designed from the inside out, Foldstruct’s designs are not merely a form of taste, but an equation of mathematical equilibrium meant for cost effective and energy efficient manufacturing. Using unique patented algorithms and a digital fabrication method, free forms can be adapted to architecture and engineering on various scales and transform the way we think about a building or about a city.
Foldstruct’s mission is to free architecture from cubical repetitiveness s and allow freeform for the masses, and not for the rich only. We want to change the way streets looks, and treat every building as an icon waiting to happen.

About
Kitchen On Go is a fully-equipped kitchen space integrated with the additional sales channel for a food brand to expand and deliver 4x more sales than limiting to online food aggregator platforms.
Cloud-kitchens is surely a cost-efficient model to expand but not really an effective solution to sustain as it’s aggressive dependent on online sales and with the rising competition cloud-kitchens barely make any sleek profits.
Our fully equipped hybrid cloud-kitchens offer all kind of kitchen space on rent ranging from 50-1200 Sq.ft and empowers the food partners to go an extra mile through exclusive access to: 1) Rs. 2 Crs worth yearly contract catering orders via Caterbinge marketplace and 2) Drive-in vertical which allows buyers to visit the premises as we have huge parking space for direct takeaways.
Our flexible solution enables a food partner to operate as they like: -Deliver your cooked food at our kitchens where we take care of your SOPs for the delivery without causing you any operational hustle. (or) -Self operate directly from our kitchens by deploying your team of chefs.

About
iMeasure Ltd. is developing revolutionary camera-based measurement technology that will rapidly and precisely measure three-dimensional structures in conjunction with augmented reality technology.
The company’s initial focus is to develop a unique, easy-to-use measuring device with unparalleled accuracy for the construction industry and related service providers who spend billions of dollars annually for measurement devices and services.
iMeasure will be easy to use, shorten construction times, reduce costly measurement mistakes, lower construction costs and save the time and expense of travel to construction sites.
By digitizing 3D space, iMeasure intends to change the construction sector in the same way that the cellphone revolutionized the business and private sectors. It will be used in conjunction with a tablet, PC or augmented reality glasses, and far surpass manual and laser-based measurement devices.
The iMeasure will quickly and accurately calculate precise measurements of an area and objects in it, overlay those measurements on a view of the area appearing on a tablet, or a visor attached to a hard hat, and enable users to layer in other data, such as architectural drawings or diagrams, by selecting from a menu appearing on the screen.
iMeasure will enable the transmission of accurate measurement data and images to off-site suppliers in real-time (e.g. carpenters, plumbers, window manufacturers and furniture makers), provide exact dimensions and measurements of a building space, and eliminate trips to building sites by each supplier.
iMeasure’s ease of use, speed, accuracy, immediate processing and transmission capability, will transform iMeasure into a ‘must-have’ tool for contractors, interior designers, real estate agents and municipal inspectors. Its 3D capabilities will enable it to compete successfully against laser-based measurement tools which operate on a “point to point” basis.

About
In every large construction site stands the crane, the centerpiece of today’s construction process. As demand increases and construction industrialized, cranes are utilized to their full capacity, increasing the dependency between crane efficiency and site productivity. Syracuse enables cranes to operate autonomously, transporting loads safer and up to 60% faster, enhancing site productivity and profitability.
Syracuse provides a complete HW and SW solution, enabling cranes to operate autonomously. The Syracuse solution incorporates standard crane industry systems augmented with advanced autonomous components, including motion sensors, cameras, and LiDAR. Syracuse is easily installed on the crane, with limited maintenance and maximum durability.
Syracuse captures a wide range of visual and sensor data, as the crane maneuvers throughout the construction site. Data captured includes crane operation, load dimensions and positioning and as-built construction monitoring. Syracuse real-time data significantly improves control and management of the construction process.

About
Effective Building is a new startup aiming to simplify and optimize the building products and materials selection for all green building projects.
Green projects require access to materials’ data that is not available to professionals. Therefore construction professionals spend too much time searching for products’ data, and eventually selecting whatever they found, and not the best products for their project.
We eliminate this by making all the needed data easily available to all.
We collect technical and functional data on products we host, not just their green certification information. That means that you search for products by technical functional properties as well.

Our innovative rental finance platform helps you manage your risk, cut your losses, gain insight into your portfolio and earn revenue, all in one place.
We are data technologists who recognize that today’s renter deserves financial flexibility and fewer obstacles for housing choices. Meanwhile housing providers collect $63 billion in deposits in the United States that do not offer good security.
We develop scalable, technology driven solutions that get tenants into the apartments that they love and gives landlords all the security they need and more.

About
A MassChallenge Israel 2019 Winner, DrizzleX is a pioneering smart water metering solution that enables significant water conservation in residential buildings that lack individual apartment meters. While water is a scarce, precious, and depleting resource, it is still free for tenants and overused by 30% in tens of millions of US apartments in multifamily apartment buildings where there is no transparency about individual tenant water consumption. This water misuse negatively impacts properties’​ bottom line, while costly leaks go undetected, causing additional damages. DrizzleX’s solution generates data-driven transparency about water usage by combining the proprietary, cost-effective, maintenance-free, and quick to install FlowDX™ smart water sensors, with a robust SaaS dashboard displaying data, comparative trends, alerts, and AI-powered insights. By measuring individual units’ water consumption in multi-family properties, detecting water misuse and leaks in real-time, and leveraging data to educate and empower both tenants and property managers to conserve water, DrizzleX reduces water use, significantly slashes bills and property expenses, and positively impacts the environment. Founded in 2017, DrizzleX is based in Israel with installations across California, Nevada, Arizona, and New York.

It’s the cloud-based property management, trust accounting, and real estate software for agencies who want to do less, and make more. Thousands of the most successful agencies across Australia and New Zealand depend on Console for its leading property management & trust accounting software. Console creates property management and trust accounting software for real estate agencies in Australia and New Zealand. In 1992, our pioneering spirit spurred us to design the first property management software ever released in Australia. We’ve continued to reach new frontiers in advanced trust accounting software, and push the boundaries of what’s possible in end-to-end property management solutions. We’ve achieved this by staying true to principles of quality design, and by working collaboratively with our customers. After 26 years of market leadership, we have not lost that spark of ambition. In 2017, Console released its first cloud-based property management software, Console Cloud. Since its release, we have developed advanced SaaS (software as a service) technologies, which we’ve made more robust through a strong beta testing program. The result: In less than two years, Console Cloud has evolved to become a premier cloud-based property management solution. It’s beginning to redefine what software can do. We do not intend to slacken the pace. Console continues to create trailblazing software and apps that support the property manager of today and their ecosystem—software that’s mobile, user-friendly, and intuitive. Console is changing what software can do, so property managers can achieve what they never thought possible.

About
Flyability is a Swiss company building safe drones for inaccessible places. By allowing drones to be used safely inside cities, inside buildings, and in contact with people, it enables new interactions and services with UAVs and solving the two most critical issues of one of the fastest growing industries: collision and injury risks.
The company’s first market is in industrial inspection where it avoids sending people in dangerous and confined spaces for the inspection of Energy, Oil & Gas or transport infrastructure. It is also active in Search & Rescue and Security to assess emergency situations without putting humans at risk.

About
Flyability is a Swiss company building safe drones for inaccessible places. By allowing drones to be used safely inside cities, inside buildings, and in contact with people, it enables new interactions and services with UAVs and solving the two most critical issues of one of the fastest growing industries: collision and injury risks.
The company’s first market is in industrial inspection where it avoids sending people in dangerous and confined spaces for the inspection of Energy, Oil & Gas or transport infrastructure. It is also active in Search & Rescue and Security to assess emergency situations without putting humans at risk.

About
Plenty is a new kind of farm for a new kind of world. We’re on a mission to bring fresh, local produce to communities everywhere in a way that’s better for the environment. Our local field-scale indoor farms are creating a healthier, more delicious and sustainable future.
The world is in dire need of rapid innovation in order to feed the 7+ billion humans on Earth without continuing to destroy it, and Plenty is here to deliver! Our vertical farms use 99% less water than conventional fields, are pesticide-free, and produce zero fertilizer runoff. And since our farms are local, we cut thousands of miles out of the supply chain, reducing tons of emissions.
Fortunately, the most powerful trends occurring in technology today create the opportunity to address agriculture’s biggest challenges. The amalgamation of crop science, artificial intelligence, big data and the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), coupled with falling energy prices and the availability of increasingly efficient LED lighting create the opportunity to completely overhaul how the world grows produce.
Plenty’s produce is always seasonal and more flavorful than anything you can find on the market today. We’re creating a healthier, more delicious and more sustainable future for the world.

About
Bowery is growing food for a better future by revolutionizing agriculture. Our modern farming company combines the benefits of the best local farms with advances made possible by technology to grow produce you can feel good about eating. BoweryOS, our proprietary software system, uses vision systems, automation technology, and machine learning to monitor plants and all the variables that drive their growth 24/7. Because we control the entire process from seed to store, Bowery farms use zero pesticides, 95% less water, and are 100+ times more productive on the same footprint of land than traditional agriculture. Bowery produce is currently available at select Whole Foods and Stop & Shop stores in the Tri-state area; Brooklyn Fare, Westside Market and Foragers Market in NYC; and online through Peapod, AmazonFresh and Jet.com. Additionally, Bowery is featured at sweetgreen, and on the menus of Tom Colicchio’s New York restaurants Craft and Temple Court. Based in New York City, the company has raised $122.5M from leading investors including GV, General Catalyst, GGV Capital, First Round Capital, Temasek and Almanac.

About
Bowery is growing food for a better future by revolutionizing agriculture. Our modern farming company combines the benefits of the best local farms with advances made possible by technology to grow produce you can feel good about eating. BoweryOS, our proprietary software system, uses vision systems, automation technology, and machine learning to monitor plants and all the variables that drive their growth 24/7. Because we control the entire process from seed to store, Bowery farms use zero pesticides, 95% less water, and are 100+ times more productive on the same footprint of land than traditional agriculture. Bowery produce is currently available at select Whole Foods and Stop & Shop stores in the Tri-state area; Brooklyn Fare, Westside Market and Foragers Market in NYC; and online through Peapod, AmazonFresh and Jet.com. Additionally, Bowery is featured at sweetgreen, and on the menus of Tom Colicchio’s New York restaurants Craft and Temple Court. Based in New York City, the company has raised $122.5M from leading investors including GV, General Catalyst, GGV Capital, First Round Capital, Temasek and Almanac.

About
Built Technologies was founded in 2014 out of firsthand frustration with the challenges and pitfalls often associated with construction lending and the belief that technology could transform the loan management process. Built’s collaborative software streamlines the collateral monitoring and draw management process – a process widely recognized as highly cumbersome, costly, and fraught with risk. By bringing the draw management process online, Built helps lenders reduce construction loan risk, increase loan profitability, transform the borrower experience, simplify compliance, and provide unprecedented portfolio insights. With Built, lenders have access to real-time data to make more informed decisions on their construction portfolio while simultaneously providing borrowers a convenient, digital experience with faster access to money to push projects forward. Built has begun a rapid growth trajectory. Since January 2017, the company has more than tripled its customer base, which includes small, regional, and national lenders coast-to-coast. In the 30 months since going live, lenders have used the Built platform to manage over $13 billion of construction loan volume.

About
PlanRadar is a cloudbased SaaS (Software as a Service) solution for construction documentation and defect management in real estate projects. In each real estate project are in average 1-2 defects per 10m² – we help to manage them!
Our solution with web access and native apps for smartphones and tablets supports the user in recording, documentation, communication and tracking of tasks and defects. Project managers, architects, technicans and facility & property managers can record tasks, defects, quality checks, etc. in a cost & time saving way directly on the construction site with their tablet or smartphone and assign them in real time to the responsible project stakeholders.
The problems of construction documentation and defect management leading to unsatisfying adjustment of defects and additional costs are:
– the annoying and inefficient recording of tasks and defects
– the inefficient communication with other project stakeholders
– the problems according to incomplete communication, inconsistent versioning and information opacity
PlanRadar is the digital solution of this process and is realizing cost and time savings of 60-70%.
PlanRadar is cloudbased, that means there is no installation required and it can be used anywhere and anytime, also offline. PlanRadar can be used on all browsers and platforms with native apps for smartphones and tablets.
The user uploads blueprints and is able to pin any defects or tasks directly via his smartphone or tablet on the blueprint and then share and communicate them with other project stakeholders (e.g. suppliers, owners, etc.) and also track and follow up the enhancements. The whole communication and worksflow is documented and can be used for reports and revision.
Your advantages are:
– Cloudbased (no installation; used anywhere, anytime, also offline)
– Ease of Use (fast, intuitive; no training (support effort/user/year ca. 1h)
– All platforms (browsers, tablets, smartphones).

About
Sensorberg digitizes buildings and turns lifeless concrete bodies into digital worlds of experience that make our lives and our work much easier. Even more: a real experience. Through digitalization, it is possible to get even closer to the customer and to represent his needs even more precisely through appropriate offers. Using smartphones, users can enter a building without a card or key, operate elevators, book meeting rooms at short notice or adjust the room temperature to suit their needs. Smart home or office technology from Sensorberg makes this possible – in a very direct way.
Taking access to the building as a starting point, interactive solutions extend to include meeting room reservations and employee/visitor management. Sensorberg takes a clear focus on simplicity, transparency and user experience. The solution is available for both outfitting new building constructions and retrofitting existing infrastructures.
Sensorberg is a Berlin-based technology company founded in 2013. Sensorberg employs about 30 workers and is headquartered in Berlin. Michael von Roeder is the CEO.

About




RentBook is Australia’s first online property management solution.
Since in April 2008, RentBook has connected landlords, managers and tenants maintain their rental records and history online.
Whether you manage your own property or manage on behalf of others, there is lots of paperwork and keeping track of records that RentBook has automated.
One of the aims of RentBook is to assist tenants in maintaining accurate and timely rental records. We have found that by giving the tenants online access to their records, they are much more likely to pay accurately and on time.
If you manage properties for others, then both the tenant and the property owner are able to view the lease details and payment histories. This cuts down on the number of phone calls and queries about rental payments.
Also tenants and landlords can send messages via RentBook, this allows for a history of correspondance than can be very handy in maintaining effective communication, one of the main areas where rental disputes occur.

About
We believe the rental process is very segmented and stressful. Software today is costly and does not provide the right workflow needed to close deals or manage properties efficiently and as cost-effectively as possible for owners and operators.
By creating a free and enterprise-level property management software with a focus on streamlining and enhancing the entire rental and management process for your team and tenant no cost to you, we will improve your operations and bottom line. Renters will appreciate the phenomenal experience, and that will create new loyalties to your brand.

ATLANT is addressing two of the most pertinent problems in real estate with its decentralized blockchain platform: Tokenized Ownership and global P2P Rentals.
[Tokenized Ownership]
Listing of real estate tokens representing shares in individual real estate assets and their liquid trading in a transparent and orderly market with price discovery.
[P2P Rentals]
Significantly reduced fees for both the tenant and lessor & minimized possibility of fake reviews and forged ratings, which plagues existing centralized services such as Airbnb and Booking.

About
HouseTrip is an award-winning start-up making hotels a thing of the past.
Founded by CEO Arnaud Bertrand and CFO Junjun Chen, HouseTrip.com went live in January 2010.
We’re now one of the world’s largest holiday rental booking sites, in 2012 voted the #2 start-up in all of London, and are growing all the time.
For the price of a tiny, soulless hotel room, our Guests are discovering that instead they can have an entire house, or apartment, or castle, or boat… We have over 300,000 quality properties in thousands of destinations around the globe – many with unbiased reviews from previous Guests – and our list is growing every day.
When you stay in somebody’s home, you get to experience the authentic reality of their neighbourhood, their city and their country. Your holiday with HouseTrip means getting to live like a local; relishing local restaurants, taking in resident sights and sounds and enjoying all the bits of your chosen destination that most visitors don’t ever learn about. Shop for produce at the markets and then prepare a feast in your very own kitchen, or even put on a load of washing.
Renting with HouseTrip is safe, because Guests use their debit/credit card to pay online with our secure system – no more risky money transfers. Plus, we hold back on paying the Host until two days after you’ve checked in for added security.

Estate agency has long awaited disruption to the mystique of finding buyers and guiding people through the home moving process. Emoov.co.uk are innovating the property industry by providing a fair cost solution to selling across England, Scotland and Wales. The same result (actually, better) for a fee that is several times less than the high street, typically. We combine technology with great people to sell houses better, faster and for a greater price than the high street.
We make customer satisfaction our number 1 priority and that’s why we have been voted the UK No 1 Hybrid Estate Agent for customer service 3 years in a row. (Source: AllAgents)
Our team is industry leading and comprises Founder & CEO Russell Quirk, a renowned property expert, PR whizz and customer service obsessive; and Ivan Ramirez as CTO, formerly VP of Global Product at Groupon.com. The additional senior team in marketing, technology, sales and operations is world class.
Venture backed, we have raised a number of investment rounds at increasingly enthusiastic valuations.

Appear Here is the leading online marketplace for short-term retail space. The mission: to create a world where anyone, anywhere can find space for their ideas.
Over 200,000 industry leading brands, designers and creative entrepreneurs are using Appear Here to find and book retail space. Appear Here lists over 7,000 spaces in the top retail destinations across the world, including London, Paris and New York.
Everyone from global brands such as Apple, Chanel and Net-a-porter to innovative startups like Supreme, Spotify and Made.com, plus 1000’s independent brands and designers have used Appear Here to launch their ideas. To date, Appear Here has launched over 10,000 new stores.
Appear Here is building a global network of the best retail spaces and working exclusively with some of the biggest landlords in the world including Land Securities, Hammerson and Westfield. Spaces listed on Appear Here include prime high street shops, underground stations, unique venues, major shopping malls and historic buildings. In 2015, Appear Here launched In Residence: a collection of spaces inside some of the world’s best boutiques, hotels and gyms.
All spaces are exclusive to Appear Here and can be booked by the week or month. Traditionally it takes on average 3-6 months to book a shop. With Appear Here, it takes just 3-6 days to book a shop. The current record is seven minutes.
The company was launched in February 2013 by the 20-year-old Ross Bailey. The idea came from a pop-up shop Ross launched for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee called Rock and Rule. Realising how many people, like him, wanted a solution to renting retail space flexibly, Ross used the proceeds from Rock and Rule to launch Appear Here.
To date, Appear Here has raised over $20 Million in funding from backers including Europe’s largest Venture Capital firm Balderton Capital, Octopus Ventures, MMC Ventures and Meyer Bergman. The team has grown to over 80 people with offices in London, Paris and New York.

Change is inevitable in any construction project. BaseStone ensures you are kept up-to-date and always have the relevant information at your fingertips, with all stages of the issue resolution process tracked and resolved so that you can deliver more projects, on time, and on budget.

About
Being safe should be simple. SimpliSafe designs home security systems that are wireless, cellular and so user-friendly they can be set up by anyone in minutes. An ever-expanding arsenal of sensors and the SimpliSafe security camera, SimpliCam, provides all-encompassing protection while integrated apps make comprehensive system control possible from anywhere.
But SimpliSafe is way more than its great products. It’s also seamless 24/7 professional monitoring, without the long-term contracts and sky-high prices of traditional alarm companies.
Currently, SimpliSafe protects over 2 million Americans and that number is quickly rising. In 2014, the company was ranked in The Inc. 500 as one of the fastest growing private companies in the nation with a 3,076% 3-year growth rate. SimpliSafe is ushering in a new era — one where anyone anywhere can have a security system that’s not only simple, but also on the cutting edge.

About
Sonos wirelessly fills every room with clear, room-filling sound at any volume. Listen your way on a smart system that’s easy to set-up, control and expand.
In 2002, Sonos set out to reinvent the way people listen at home. The wireless home sound system we created makes it easier than ever to fill any and every room with music, podcasts, TV, and just about anything else you could ever want to hear—all with brilliant, immersive clarity. Since then millions of people in over 60 countries have made Sonos part of their lives.
Today we remain focused on innovation, thoughtfully designing products, inventing new technologies, expanding our software platform, crafting the best sound experience and making a positive social impact in the world.
We’re empowering people to listen better because listening builds understanding and drives change. It even increases happiness and brings people together. Simply put, listening leads to a better life. (We’ve got the data to prove it.)
Are you interested in innovating at Sonos? Here’s what we look for:
You’re not like everyone else.
You bring a unique perspective to the table. Transparency tops your list of values. Your smarts and creativity are off the charts, matched only by your humility. You want to collaborate with a team of diverse talent. You proactively contribute to a culture of respect and inclusion.
You enjoy a challenge.
Inquisitive and focused, you see every challenge as an opportunity. You’re ambitious and unafraid to make mistakes because you learn from them and bounce back quickly. You don’t stop until you get it right. “Impossible” isn’t in your vocabulary. You’re more interested in creating the future than waiting for it.
You love to listen.
You start every interaction from a place of listening and seeking to understand. You’re culturally connected. You remember your first concert. You can readily recommend a binge-worthy show on Netflix, Hulu or HBO. You can’t sit in traffic without a great audiobook, podcast or album. You can make a killer playlist. Your idea of a good weekend includes watching a movie or playing a video game.

About
We want to welcome you to the future of intelligent pet care.
Petnet has created the world’s first SmartFeeder. It is an elegant hardware device that will program itself around your life and the wellness of your precious pet.
With the help of sophisticated sensors, your web-enabled smartphone and the processing power of a computer, SmartFeeder learns how much and when you feed your pet. In about a week, it gets adjusted to your schedule and keeps you in tune to your pet’s eating regimen.
Why we built SmartFeeder?
Most pet parents don’t think about what and how much they feed their pets and the long lasting effect it can have on their health. The fact is, the majority of today’s pet food is either wasted or over consumed by our pets which is why we have seen a staggering increase in pet obesity the last several years. According to one study, An Estimated 54% of Dogs and Cats in the United States are Overweight or Obese directly due to overeating and the way we feed our pets.
Pet parents do not currently have the convenience of being able to consistently monitor their pets eating habits. What if a pet feeder could program itself around your life and the wellness of your pet, not the other way around?
This is exactly what SmartFeeder does. It learns how much and when you feed your pet and guides you towards a more healthy eating regimen.

About
ecobee Inc. introduced the world’s first smart wi-fi thermostat to help millions of consumers save money, conserve energy, and seamlessly bring home automation into their lives. With the release of ecobee Switch+, we continue our pursuit to create technology that brings peace of mind and harmony into the home, allowing people to focus on the moments that matter most. ecobee was founded by Stuart Lombard, whose love for tinkering can be traced back to the age of 12, when he built a foldable canoe that could be carried around in a briefcase.
ecobee has been praised for its intuitive design, pioneering room sensor technology, and providing users an environmentally friendly solution—leading to our status as a #1 ranked product on Navigant’s Smart Thermostat Leaderboard.
We’re a rapidly growing tech company in the heart of downtown Toronto and we employ some of Canada’s leading engineers and developers. ecobee is a fun and casual workplace with an open concept office, an in-office bike rack & lots of free snacks.
We take pride in making a meaningful difference to the environment, all while being part of the exciting connected home revolution!

About
Seebo enables process manufacturers to predict and prevent unexpected process inefficiencies that continually damage production yield and quality. The company’s solutions empower production teams to:
Discover process inefficiencies and their operational impact
Pinpoint why these process inefficiencies happen
Predict when they will happen next
Seebo solutions employ Explainable AI technology, adapted to the complex dependencies of multi time-series data that is inherent to process manufacturing. Using a visual, code-free modeler, a client’s end-to-end production line processes and manufacturing knowhow are captured into an AI-powered digital twin – without requiring the client to master data science.
The Seebo Industrial IoT Platform is the backbone of our solutions. The platform is based on Process-Based Industrial AI, with tools that enable quick, code-free configuration and customization of the solutions:
Digital Twin Modeling – Visual tool for graphically modeling the client’s process digital twin, based on the customer’s specific production processes, OT and IT data, use cases, and customized digital twin dashboards. Seebo automatically transforms the Model into a digital prototype of the solution, enabling customer teams to validate the solution ahead of implementation, and gain internal buy-in from all relevant stakeholders.
Process-Based Predictive Analytics – Automatically translates the Model’s business use cases to rule-driven alerts, and provides an iterative means – using supervised and unsupervised machine learning – to automatically derive actionable insights from historical data and real-time data.
Automated Root Cause Analysis – Detects the possible root causes of actual and forecasted production problems using anomaly detection, pattern analysis and correlation analysis. Reduces the time and efforts for problem investigation, resolution, and prevention.
Digital Twin Analytics- visualizes the manufacturing KPIs, alerts, and reports in the visual context of the production processes, providing managers with complete operational intelligence, from the site level, through production lines, to specific machines, and individual sensors.
Manufacturers across industries – including Nestle, Grundfos, Stanley, Procter & Gamble, Hovis, and many more – use Seebo to increase throughput while continually improving quality.
Founded in 2012, the company has raised over $25M from Viola Ventures, TPY Capital, Pritzker Group, and other investors. Seebo was named a Gartner Cool Vendor in the Internet of Things for 2017.

About
IdealSpot helps everyone in the commercial real estate and retail ecosystems better understand local markets and communities through the use of better data. For instance, when and where are people signaling that they actually want or need something—like a cup of coffee, yoga classes, an apartment, a new marketing job, or a car loan? To answer this question we combine demand (signaled intent via online behavior) with best-in-class traditional datasets (demographics, behavior, vehicle traffic data, spending, etc.) to find market gaps and opportunities for our clients.
In other words, we remove the difficult and time-consuming data collection and analysis steps from geographic market analysis workflows. We ingest, refine, and transform high-quality, nationwide geospatial market data into on-demand, problem-solving infographic reports – all through a simple, self-service platform. Our pricing structure is designed to make solutions available at a rate even small businesses and startups can afford.

About
Home energy is yours to control.
You can harness the sun’s abundant energy to power the coffeemaker in the morning. You can store that energy and light up the dinner table at night. With solar panels on your roof and batteries in your home, the power is in your hands.
Our climate is changing, and our energy system needs to change with it. Delivering electricity across long power lines from big power plants is leading to more power outages, rate increases, and dangerous conditions.
At Sunrun, we know there is a better way. By generating and storing energy in our homes, we can share power across neighborhoods and our entire energy system. We have been building this future for over a decade, and every year it grows brighter. Now is the time to make your own energy. Share it with your neighbors. Build a clean, affordable, reliable future for the whole nation.

About
Acre creates beautiful, simple and smart net zero homes.
BEAUTIFUL
Purposeful design results in homes that are better for people and the planet. Acre’s zero-energy homes are filled with daylight, fresh air, and carefully crafted details – for a healthy, comfortable home that reflects your lifestyle and your values.
SIMPLE
We eliminate the pain of typical construction with curated options, straightforward pricing and a rapid build. But the process is only part of the story. We obsess over high-quality, low-maintenance details throughout, to make living in an Acre home a joy.
SMART
We bring together the most advanced materials and technologies, for a home that functions like a modern product should. Completely powered by the sun, responsive and flexible in design, and built upon technology. It’s how our homes define a different future.

About
Why should your house be built the same way as it was thousands of years ago, by taking raw materials to the site?
Proto Homes’ proprietary system of Integrated Component Based Construction™ (ICBC™) results in precise system-built homes. We transport factory-built foundational, structural, infrastructural and architectural components to the construction site and assemble them in half the time and cost of equivalent stick-built homes. Just like high-end custom homes, Proto Houses are designed based on site-specific requirements and assembled at the site, under complete scrutiny and inspection of local building department officials. Unlike many modular and manufactured prefab homes, our homes meet the same traditional financing as site-built homes.
By choosing Proto Homes, your home will be Well-Designed, Built-To-Last, Affordable, Functional, Smart, Reliable, Easily Maintained and Upgradable, surpassing the Promise of Prefab and realizing the intent of Modern Architecture; A Prefab Revolution!

About
We are a leading Software as a Service and solutions provider in the fields of industrial predictive analytics, process optimization, and energy management.
Our groundbreaking analytics platform and intuitive visual interface allow engineers to optimize industrial processes, detect root causes of unforeseen events, and identify sources of energy savings. With a drag-and-drop graphical user interface built on top of a powerful analytics engine, our software helps engineers and citizen data scientists rapidly make new insights into their systems and processes, without requiring advanced training in programming or statistics.
Our cloud-based software platform imports, aggregates, and validates data from various sources, including Microsoft tools; relational databases; and real-time data from industrial machinery, sensors, control systems, and power-consumption monitors. Users create data models using a visual interface, and results can be monitored in realtime through a visual dashboard or returned to a facility’s process control system via interfaces. Through machine learning each model becomes more intelligent over time.

About
Building functionalities are changing constantly. Today isn’t quite like yesterday and will be different from tomorrow. That’s why bGrid creates an environment that changes accordingly. An environment that adapts to you as a user.
By applying the latest Internet of Things technologies, buildings come to life, with a high-quality technology that understands you. Technology that you understand. Advanced sensors, big data management and mobile devices that sense your desired climate, lighting and workspace. A technology that sees when you enter or leave the building and will adapt to this. Unnecessary energy and costs will no longer be lost.
A building that gets to know and learns from you at the same time so that it knows what you need, when you need it. A building that grows with you and provides growth for tomorrow. By listening to you and talking to you, we get a better and better understanding of you. By learning from you, our technology is becoming more and more advanced. With which we increasingly let buildings work on intuition. That intuition is very personal, and we learn from you. And of the things you do.
Intuition and adaptability ensure that you do not have to adjust to your schedule, your schedule adjusts to you. So you get freedom in how, where, and when you work. It makes your days more productive, safer, pleasant, but most of all more personal. And therefore more valuable.
Together with our international partners we bring your smart building wishes of tomorrow within reach. Especially together with you. Because without you we have nothing to adjust to. And that is what we are built for. To listen. To see. And to feel.

About
At Yopa, we’re making the process of selling your home affordable, simple and transparent.
We give sellers the best of both worlds: the expertise of a dedicated Local Yopa Agent to guide them through their sale, combined with the convenience and cost-saving efficiency of an online service.
Sellers get the very best price for their home, at a fraction of the usual estate agency cost.
Affordable:
We charge a small fixed fee, instead of the usual percentage of the property’s sale price.
Simple:
We put our customers at the heart of everything we do and aren’t happy unless their experience is 100% positive. On average, those who sold with Yopa rated our service 5-star on leading independent review website, Trustpilot.
Transparent:
Our technology opens the lines of communication between buyers and sellers – letting them liaise directly and allowing sellers to receive and respond to viewing requests and offers around the clock.
People are taking notice. Our critically-acclaimed national advertising campaign is now live, and we are working in partnership with The Telegraph and The Daily Mail.
We’re creating a better estate agency that demystifies the process of selling property, champions the customer, and puts them back in control.

About
Groundfloor is the first and only real estate lending marketplace open to non-accredited investors. Before Groundfloor, only accredited investors had access to the diversification, risk-adjusted returns & control available via private market investments. Groundfloor opens the door to short-term, high-yield returns backed by real estate. We bring together individual investors looking for short-term lending investments and borrowers looking for short-term financing for their specific real estate projects. The borrowers get access to more flexible, faster and cheaper capital than a traditional bank or a hard-money lender. Investors get access to short-term, high-yield investments offering returns that average over 10%.
Since funding the first Groundfloor loan in 2014, thousands of individual investors have built their own portfolios of loans ranging in yield from 5% to 23%, on terms of 6 to 12 months, starting at a minimum investment of $10 per loan.
Groundfloor earned a historic qualification by the SEC in August 2015 to sell private real estate debt investments to non-accredited investors. The company was founded in 2013 by Brian Dally and Nick Bhargava and is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Our fast-growing team is on a mission to benefit individual investors and the investments they fund by reformatting and opening private capital markets to broad public participation.

About
Leeo is a team of committed technologists and business people who have first-hand experience with aging parents endeavoring to live their lives independently. Conventional solutions neglect the family dynamic, project stigma, impose daily life changes or miss that we care about each other. It’s a mutual concern, our parents also worry and care about us.
As a result, we created Leeo Ping, a sensor enabled safety net. We also created one of the key devices that work on Ping, the next generation Smart Alert. Leeo Ping assists our family and friends, including our parents, to live more safely and independently.
We’d like to give you the freedom and assurance you want and the peace of mind your friends and family need.

About
Silicon Valley based DealSumm is a technology company that empowers its customers to automatically, rapidly and reliably extract the terms, conditions and the fine print hidden in contracts. DealSumm’s customers depend on contract and lease evaluation to conduct their business. Until DealSumm came around their review and abstraction process was a highly manual, lengthy, expensive and unreliable. In addition to automated abstraction DealSumm offers review, workflow and management modules for better utilization and sharing of the abstracted information. The first market DealSumm is focusing on is Commercial Real Estate, later on looking to impact other markets like M&A, Construction, Healthcare, Retail and Banking.
​DealSumm owns a wide portfolio of patents related to understanding and extracting data elements from contracts.
​DealSumm’s leadership team possesses the technical and the business track-record and knowhow to build, deploy and grow the company.
​DealSumm revolutionizes the application of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing. It attacks head on their inherent accuracy limitations. Using Document Structure Analysis it allows the identification of the correct answers in the prediction of contract provisions. Furthermore, DealSumm invented a technology process for a problem yet unsolved: how to calculate the financial provisions from multiple documents, i.e., the lease and its amendments, and aggregate them into one summary. DealSumm owns a portfolio of patents covering its capability to automatically handle a large variety of domain-specific contract formats. A newly designed web interface allows the user to upload contracts and it delivers a detailed and thorough abstract within minutes. DealSumm utilizes an assisted review process displaying both the original document and extracted terms for verification and approval. Summary reports, search, revenue calendar and other multi-document syntheses and analyses are automatically generated and can be exported to excel and 3rd party software.

About
Eave by HomeLight is a digital mortgage lender empowering today’s homebuyer. We offer simple, transparent home loans that enable creditworthy buyers to be treated like cash buyers.
In May 2019, Eave joined forces with Homelight to help 100,000’s of home buyers, sellers and realtors across the country. Together, we’re empowering people to achieve the best outcome when buying or selling real estate.
Saro Vasudevan, Anoop Ranganath, and Jack McCambridge founded Eave to fulfill a singular mission: make home buying easier by rebuilding the antiquated mortgage process from the ground up. We created powerful technology that can fully underwrite borrowers in just 24 hours, providing more speed and certainty in the process.
We’ve worked hard to perfect our system. We’ve helped buyers with even the most complex finances win in some of the most competitive real estate markets in the country. We’re thrilled to report that 90 percent of our buyers have won the first home they’ve bid on. Even better? We save our clients thousands of dollars and weeks of frustration.

About
flatfair is the fastest growing deposit alternative in the UK, already available in hundreds of letting branches across the country (e.g. through the Spicerhaart network).
With flatfair, landlords can offer tenants the option to pay an affordable membership fee instead of an expensive tenancy deposit. In exchange, flatfair landlords get up to double the protection compared to a deposit (up to 12 weeks worth of rent) and benefit from fewer voids.
flatfair’s technology takes away the hassle of managing deposits – from registration, change of sharer to checkout – and pays its partnered letting agents a commission for bringing on new tenants.
The UK’s residential lettings model is broken. Tenants, forced to pay expensive deposits that overlap between tenancies, miss out on opportunities to rent. For agents and landlords, this results in lost revenue and lengthy voids. To make things worse, existing deposit schemes often fall short of providing the right level of efficiency and protection. This means that when it comes to covering the cost of damages and rent arrears, agents and landlords are often left out of pocket and in need of dedicated legal assistance.
Inspired by the widespread success of deposit alternative schemes in Germany and Switzerland, flatfair was founded to deliver the same innovation in the UK.
We keep the best of the existing government scheme, whilst disrupting the way payments and protection work. This creates faster, more secure transactions and stronger safeguards for everyone involved. The inefficiencies and unaffordability, lack of adequate cover and strained relationships between landlords, agents and tenants are erased, making way for an entirely new way of renting. And we’ve only just begun.

About
The Lumiduct from Wellsun is an elegant solution for making buildings more sustainable and livable.
Buildings with the Lumiduct come to life.
During the day, the facade is activated by brilliant transparent solar panels, enabling the building to generate and save energy. At night, the facade is activated by using integrated LEDs creating a beautiful atmosphere and making it possible to communicate with the surroundings. The Lumiduct generates awareness of the dedication to sustainability and makes living in buildings featuring it a unique and comfortable experience.
By selectively shielding intense, direct light from the sun, building occupants will no longer experience harsh glare or heat, resulting in up to 40% savings on cooling costs. Because the solar panels are transparent, up to 3 times as much soft, diffused daylight will enter the building, resulting in up to 30% savings on artificial lighting costs.
With the Lumiduct, we no longer have to fight the sun; we can embrace it and with that, make optimal use of its power. With the Lumiduct, only the light we need enters the building, while the light we do not need, is turned into electricity.
Due to its design, the Lumiduct is not affected by dust or high temperatures, therefore the solar panel efficiency (30%) is maintained over its lifetime. The Lumiduct requires no maintenance and high performance is guaranteed. With Wellsun’s professional supply chain, any project, no matter the size or design, can be delivered successfully.

About
TraceAir is a software solution that helps construction teams better communicate and collaborate in order to monitor, track quantities, plan and manage jobsites.
The solution includes specialized tools for Developers, Grading Contractors, Geotech and Civil Engineers that allows them to work efficiently and effectively with up-to-date project visuals and calculations.
Sites are scanned, typically on a weekly basis, by using commercial-grade drones and then processed by our team overnight. We use the images to create a 3D model that is geo-referenced based on your local system of coordinates. The information is accessible to the whole construction team online from any device connected to the internet.
We work with large and small clients: Lennar, Fivepoint, Legacy Partners, Independent Construction, Engeo and many others have trusted us to minimize change orders, hold contractors accountable, and even finish projects ahead of schedule.

About
“Simplifying Journeys to Nature”​
CampInn’s mission:
Enable anyone, novice or experienced, to discover nature and the outdoors, through facilitating camping and other outdoors activities and services, in a simple, honest and friendly way.
CampInn is here to provide a platform for people to make it easier to go outdoors, connect with nature, and enjoy new experiences…without the hassle.
CampInn aspires to connect travelers (we call them CampInners) and campsites (we call them HostInners) through simplified communications and instant booking.
So whether sitting at home planning the next trip (well in advance) or while on the road and looking for a place at the last minute (safely on the side of the road), the CampInner can identify and book their next camping experience through our platform – easy, fast, simple.
And if an available ground, campsite, a part of it, or just somewhere flat to lay a tent or two, a HostInner signs up, uploads the most relevant information and pictures and starts managing the availability through the HostInner’s “Back Office”.
All HostInners are equal in our CampInn World.

About
There was a time when your word was your bond.
When a firm handshake meant you’d get paid.
They say the construction business used to operate like that.
But those notions are bygone.
Timely payment is more out of reach than ever
The lower you are in the project payment chain the longer you are going to wait
The promises you make might just be impossible to keep
Construction has become one of the slowest paying businesses in the world
So here’s the rub…
The experts say there’s nothing you can do about it.
That working capital, cash flow and receivables are only going to get worse
They say waiting longer, discounting your invoice and paying for things called “Supply Chain Finance
Programs” is the wave of the future.
Costs go up.
We disagree…
If the funds are there
If you do the work…
…straight, plumb and level
There’s no reason for slow payment
Take trust off of back order…
Project funds are escrowed
Promises are hardwired
Cash flow issues disappear.
Projects go faster
Costs go down
The handshake is restored.
BuildPay. Let’s shake on it.

About
Remzy is a real estate data platform for agents that empowers off-market deals. Created on the idea that as technology is changing the role of the real estate agent, so too is technology changing the way Home Buyers try to connect on a peer-to-peer level with Homeowners. Let us connect you directly to the homeowner! Of the more than 75 million homes in the U.S., at any given time, only 2% of them are actually on the market. That means that 98% of the potential housing inventory is off the market. With Remzy, we hope to attract home buyers that don’t see that as an indication that the homeowner wouldn’t sell if the right offer came along. Who knows, that offer could be yours.
Simply said, Remzy is disrupting the ever-changing landscape of real estate — without ever having to knock on a door.

MicroEnsure is at the forefront of bringing insurance to the mass market via the mobile phone. In 2013 MicroEnsure Asia was established as a joint venture between Telenor Group and the UK based MicroEnsure Holdings Limited.

About
No person is the same. No place to work or study is the same. And the way we work and study together is constantly changing. This is nothing new of course. Therefore, years ago, we realised that places to work or study needed a different approach.
We developed future-ready technology, right in the heart of Brainport Eindhoven. The result is a locker system that is all about the user. With it, we help our customers create the ideal workplace that brings together communication, focus, collaboration and relaxing.

About
Contractually makes the contracts process paperless for businesses and their lawyers. Our web software speeds up contract generation and the whole workflow of getting reviews, edits and signatures done, with all the people, parties and lawyers involved.
No more MS-Word documents emailed around to everyone, without proper version control and with long, confusing email threads.
We’re solving problems beyond e-signatures: all the stuff that happens before and all the stuff that happens after signing.

About
How we collect all homes from fossil fuel.
We believe that climate change is the biggest problem of our generation. A problem that needs to be solved quickly. We are the first generation who will experience the serious consequences and we are the last generation who can do something about it.
Homes are responsible for around 20% of total CO2 emissions in the Netherlands. This is partly due to the fact that more than 50% of Dutch homes still have energy rating D or worse. As a result, in addition to a lot of valuable (fossil) energy, unnecessary money is also wasted. We have become addicted to natural gas from Groningen. With all its consequences.
In the coming decades we will have to provide homes with energy in a completely different way. Most homes are not future-proof now. In the Netherlands alone, we are already talking about 4.1 million homes that are not yet ready for a switch to a natural gas-free and sustainable energy infrastructure.
So there is a major challenge. And a great opportunity. GreenHome is working with homeowners on this sustainable future. Our long-term objective is therefore to provide all homes with sustainable energy and to get them free from fossil fuels.
As quickly as possible.

About
At Sustainable Buildings, we transform energy and money-wasting buildings in sustainable, smart, and more efficient ones.
We help our clients save up to 35% on their energy costs thanks to a smart system that can monitor in real time where wasting occurs, as well as automatically takes measures to avoid them.
Our systems will give “life”​ to your buildings. At every moment you will be able to detect what is the temperature, humidity, CO2 levels at single room level. This means that you will be able to check (even from your smartphone) the situation in each room in real-time.
The automated control will make sure that no energy (and money) is wasted by turning off heating and lighting in empty rooms. Imagine how much money are you wasting right now when someone forgets to turn off the lights or heating when they leave the building!
In addition, you can use all the generated data from the sensors for many other purposes. For instance, you want to understand if the energy saving measurements you are implementing in your buildings are effective. Is the new isolation making me save money? Is the new LED lighting effective? Are the newly installed solar panels producing enough energy?
Or you can display in public dashboards around your building the conditions being measured in your building. What is the temperature, humidity, CO2 levels in the building?

Project management for smarter construction companies. Digitising the construction industry one project at a time. Used in more than 100.000 projects worldwide. Proud winners of a number of awards.
We believe in digitally managed construction projects, happy customers, costs that are kept in check and dramatically reduced administration.
Fieldly is all about our users. We share their opposition toward systems that ask as much of you as you would like them to do for you. Time-consuming and complicated systems make field workers and project managers pick up pen and paper. We’re on a mission to change that. We invite you to join us.

About
Propy is a Silicon Valley proptech company revolutionizing home purchasing globally by deploying smart contracts on the blockchain.
Our disruptive solution helps buyers find a dream home, sellers find the best buyer, the agents and the title company to do the paperwork online, essentially all of them participate in a seamless online process.
We have developed three connected products Listing Platform, Transaction Platform, and Blockchain Title Registry but also each of them can work independently:
The listing platform allows sellers and their agents to get access to the global real estate market and connect with remote, overseas buyers and investors.
Transaction platform on which buyers, sellers, their agents, and escrow agents can close a traditional real estate transaction entirely online, including signing the offer, payment, and title recording.
Blockchain-enabled title registry allows counties in the US and central authorities in other countries to record a property ownership data on blockchain rather than conventional databases

About
HomeUnion is an online real estate investing platform, specializing in single-family rental (SFR) properties.
Real Estate investing has always lagged stock market investing when it comes to data and analytics-driven decision making. Where stock market investors have had past performance trends and triggers impacting future performance, real estate investors have had to rely on driving by neighborhoods and tribal knowledge. HomeUnion® changes all of that. We use Big Data to analyze neighborhoods and properties across the country to bring the same level of rich risk-reward calibration that stock market investors have had access to.

About
The Swiss company Locatee focuses on the development of the same-named smart building platform for workspace optimisation. The platform allows for an analysis of workspace utilisation and enables large organisations to make fact-based real estate decisions. It also shapes the way employees interact with an organisation’s office buildings.
The software solution analyses data sources in real time by leveraging an organisation’s existing IT infrastructure. It provides detailed information on the workspace utilisation in office buildings without the need to implement additional costly and high-maintenance hardware. The solution provides scalable insights, regardless of the size of a real estate portfolio. It is easy to roll out and maintain, and complies with data privacy legislation.
The smart building platform is being developed with a strong focus on and a deep understanding of Corporate Real Estate and Facilities Management challenges in the modern working environment.

About
We build algorithms that mimic the structural engineer’s workflow of the preliminary phase according to: the strategy he imposes local code regulations construction method applied loads The algorithm is a reinforced machine learning type. This means that it re-designs hundreds and thousands of different structures, learns from the experience of designing and, at a certain point, provides the optimal design. The optimal design is the design that follows all the rules and strategies imposed by the engineer under the lowest execution price.

About
UbiQD is a materials manufacturer and a technology source. Today we sell QDs and QD films both directly and through distributors. Longer term, we intend to focus on a B2B model that leverages existing channels to market. UbiQD’s materials are designed to be ‘drop-in’ additives to existing products (eg, conventional ag films or windows). Our novel quantum dots (stable, low-cost, non-toxic) have many applications, but internally we are focused on enabling smart building facades, specifically spectrum-controlled greenhouse films and solar windows. We also have expertise with anti-counterfiet security inks and lighting.

About
Founded in 2015 within the Innovative Enterprises business incubator of the Politecnico di Torino, Enerbrain has developed energy retrofit solutions for large buildings that allow drastic cuts in consumption as well as a significant improvement in internal comfort. Thanks to innovative IoT hardware and powerful algorithms in the cloud to fine-tune energy usage in real time Enerbrain allows operational savings. The main focus goes beyond energy by providing the best indoor air quality and educating occupants in order to generate a wider social impact thanks to engagement tools and a new way to access data across devices.
Compatible with all HVAC systems, Enerbrain system provides the application of plug & play sensors in the building and a device to act to regulate in real time ventilation, heating and cooling based on the reference parameters: outdoor and indoor temperature, relative humidity, CO2 and occupants in the building connected with powerful algorithms.
A smart innovation, which quickly affects the energy management of a building without changes to the existing systems or without drastic structural changes. In most cases it takes two days of installation to cut energy consumption by 30% forever, improving the indoor air quality and the thermal comfort.
The system integrates a unified management through an analytical dashboard, also accessible through an app.
A win-win model for energy efficiency that is rewarded trough the savings in bills and takes on a strategic value for the enhancement of real estate assets.

About
Both the philosophical nature and analytical approach of physics contribute to our devotion towards it. The world around us is for a large part designed by humans, defining how we live, work and dream. Often we forget that new insights and technologies can alter the way we see and use our surroundings. At PHYSEE we see from a physicist angle and so we are always changing the perspective.
We believe that sustainable innovation should be without compromise. By challenging the status quo with innovative clean energy technologies such as our PowerWindow. PowerWindow is a clean energy producing tinted window that generates electricity by combining three existing technologies in an innovative way.
The efficiency of our PowerWindow scales inversely with the transparency, so that you can incorporate the windows in the design of your building, without compromising the functionality or aesthetics thereof – innovation without compromise!

About
Hexagon is a global leader in sensor, software and autonomous technologies committed to a simple, yet powerful purpose: Putting data to work to empower an autonomous future.
The idea of putting data to work is part of Hexagon’s DNA. Our legacy has always been linked to data, which our core capabilities demonstrate.
Core capabilities
Hexagon emerged as a global a leader in sensor solutions nearly 20 years ago.
Our reality capture technologies enable the digital capture of the physical world — from distance measurements (point A to point B) to attributes of physical world objects (e.g. auto parts) to the creation of entire physical world environments in 3D (e.g. complete infrastructure of a city).
Our positioning technologies enable the location, tracking, navigation, and/or control of anything, anywhere. They power intelligent positioning ecosystems in vital industries and safety-of-life applications.
We began investing in software solutions not only to make more use of the data being captured but also to test ideas, products, and plans before they are created or executed.
We added design and simulation capabilities to replicate real-world scenarios in virtual environments — from manufacturing and assembly processes to autonomous driving.
We invested in location intelligence mapping capabilities to enable active, geo-referenced, situational intelligence for any application, providing businesses and governments with unlimited potential to incorporate high-definition, real-time, dynamic maps into their decision support systems.
Today we’re also focused on enabling autonomous everything.
Our autonomous technologies provide the ability to “autonomize” any task or process in a workflow to an entire operation or industry (e.g. mobility/transportation) — in which cars, UAVs, industrial vehicles, trains, vessels, and more can operate safely, securely, reliably, and efficiently thanks to assured autonomy and positioning.

About
InsiteVR helps architects and 3D designers easily create immersive virtual reality experiences.
At InsiteVR.com architects and 3D designers can upload existing 3D models, which are then converted and optimized for viewing in virtual reality devices like the Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard or simply on mobile devices.
Trying to understand 3D spaces by looking at static two-dimensional pictures is not intuitive. Communicating those 3D designs to a client, friend or colleague who isn’t trained to understand 3D space isn’t always trivial either. With virtual reality, architects and designers can effortlessly communicate the essence of their designs, save time and feel confident their viewer understands the design.
Part of this process means creating an easy-to-understand user interface for exploring and interacting with 3D models in virtual reality. We must bridge the gap between simplicity and functionality in 3D space, a new frontier of design.
Our goal is to bring down the barrier to creating virtual reality experiences for those who can truly benefit from the immersion and presence that VR provides. Creating a VR experience shouldn’t require knowing a technical programming language or paying enough money to people who do. Architects and 3D artists should hone their craft and leave the VR implementation to InsiteVR.
During this journey, Insite will strive to make VR accessible for both affordable and powerful VR headsets.

About
InsiteVR helps architects and 3D designers easily create immersive virtual reality experiences.
At InsiteVR.com architects and 3D designers can upload existing 3D models, which are then converted and optimized for viewing in virtual reality devices like the Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard or simply on mobile devices.
Trying to understand 3D spaces by looking at static two-dimensional pictures is not intuitive. Communicating those 3D designs to a client, friend or colleague who isn’t trained to understand 3D space isn’t always trivial either. With virtual reality, architects and designers can effortlessly communicate the essence of their designs, save time and feel confident their viewer understands the design.
Part of this process means creating an easy-to-understand user interface for exploring and interacting with 3D models in virtual reality. We must bridge the gap between simplicity and functionality in 3D space, a new frontier of design.
Our goal is to bring down the barrier to creating virtual reality experiences for those who can truly benefit from the immersion and presence that VR provides. Creating a VR experience shouldn’t require knowing a technical programming language or paying enough money to people who do. Architects and 3D artists should hone their craft and leave the VR implementation to InsiteVR.
During this journey, Insite will strive to make VR accessible for both affordable and powerful VR headsets.

About
Visualizing a built-out space, even with the help of plans and renderings, can be a challenge. Tenants want to understand what it will look like, how it will ‘feel’ and how it will serve their business. Introducing CBRE’s Floored Build, a videogame-like 3D interactive technology that redefines the experience of visualizing space. With Floored Build, real estate professionals and tenants can explore properties from every angle, visualizing spaces that do not yet exist or are being repositioned for specific needs.
Using Floored Build, teams work closely with developers and architects to build a virtual 3D model that turns sketches, photos, floor plans and CAD plans into bespoke 3D experiences. 3D rendered spaces are delivered and explored via an easy to access and shareable website. CBRE’s Floored Build helps tenants imagine possibilities, experiment with space and turn ideas into reality.
Key features include:
CREATE: Floored Build offers bespoke, mobile-optimized 3D experiences, recreating existing spaces, visualizing remodeled spaces or demonstrating planned sites that have not yet broken ground.
EXPLORE: Virtually tour environments in fully interactive 3D, exploring both the space and exterior environments from any remote location.
CUSTOMIZE: Highlight a property’s key areas, features and views that make it unique and desirable.
SHARE: Send 3D experiences via web links and embed them into sites and presentations.
REPURPOSE: Create additional content and collateral, including screenshots, 2D renderings and promotional videos.

The robot’s versatile robotic manipulators enable the programming of a multitude of tasks that are today performed by manual labor or limited machinery.

About
Nexudus is the leading white-label management software that all coworking space owners and landlords need. We are inspired by individuals who care about the changing work culture and the growing coworking and flexible workspace movements.
Our journey began in 2012 after we discovered the concept of coworking from our friends who opened their space, WorkINcompany, in 2011. We fell in love with the idea of coworking and found a gap in the market for shared workspace software.
Since then we have worked with over 1500 spaces in more than 72 countries. Our mission is empowering and simplifying your management as a space owner. Our platform allows you to have the freedom of scaling and optimising your space without leaving your comfort zone. We will help you set up your account to reflect the special characters of your space, making management tasks flexible and easier ensuring that your language and location are no longer a barrier, enabling you to be part of the global coworking community.
Nexudus is based on two sets of features that we believe are key to building a successful coworking space:
OPERATIONS – We understand how time consuming managing a space can be and we want to make your life easier so that you can focus on engaging members and optimising their experience. Handling payments, bookings and keeping on top of who is in your space at one time are some of the daily issues for a coworking space manager. Nexudus simplifies your tasks by automating most of these processes like CRM, reminders, task lists, billing, etc whilst integrating with several systems such as access control, printing management, visitor management and wifi access and enhancing your experience through surveys, a mobile app for your users to access your space on the go and much more
COMMUNICATION – Building a community is key to growing a successful coworking space and our simple and user-friendly interface helps to achieve this by supporting a coworking network around your space.

About
metanoia is a developer of technological solutions for promoting and selling real estate projects.
During 2013, the concept of Virtual Reality has still been considered as futuristic and inaccessible, and was mostly used in video-games. Whereas the real estate market continued asking clients to “imagine” their future home while taking one of the most pivotal and emotional action.
Thanks to our vast experience in the field, we’ve recognized a gap between clients’ expectations and reality; a gap that might damage the selling process or even worse – the total client experience. Their ability to imagine their future home relies upon so many variables, that it’s a challenge to find a proper solution for that matter, even today.
metanoia is a pioneer in the field of VR and stands in the forefront of this revolutionary field. Its uniqueness stems from its ability to combine revolutionary technologies with a sharp and relentless marketing strategy.
The company’s main goal is to provide the most advanced and innovative products available in the market today. These, in turn, will improve selling process and clients’ sense of satisfaction with the overall buying experience.

About
Leaperr is a smart computerized system capable of designing interior spaces independently ,
by itself, without the need for a human designer.
Leaperr enables everyday users (non-professional as well as professional designers) to harness the power of cutting-edge technology and produce high-quality interior designs within minutes.
The technology is based on artificial intelligence system. It combines Deep-Learning, Image-Processing algorithms and stochastic methods that automatically produces interior designs based on specific user requests. Designs are creative and unique, made by the machine itself, without any human assistance.
Unique algorithms captures user’s needs & preferences, space structure as well other constrains.
The system studies large amount of data consists of high-level images.
This allows it to “understand”​ design contexts such as- color combinations, textures , location of items, lights, sizes, functionality and more.
The system instantly creates various personalized designs (tailor-made) for any given space.
The whole processes takes only few minutes.
Customers don’t have to imagine or visualize how the design will look like, rather they can actually see it in a “photo like”​ vivid and tangible image that demonstrates the full visual potential of the space.
Anyone can use Leaperr and receive amazing Results. No pre-designing knowledge is required.
Leaperr makes it possible to fully realize and visualize the most abstract design plans of interior design while, at the same time save both time & money.
Leaperr is a game-changing interior-design paradigm, it makes the process of interior designing easy , quick and even enjoyable.

About
Our mission is to bring a world class experiences to every office in the world. We solve the everyday pain points experienced by millions of landlords, property managers, companies, retailers, vendors with our modular technology that’s easy to customize.
We discovered that 81% of office leasing decisions are based on experiences with the building company and their staff. How quickly can you get a new key fob? Are there parking spots left underground? How do you book a shared space? Questions like these are easily answered using Lane’s app and website portal. Tenants benefit from a streamlined, well-designed experience that saves time and frustration—plus they are instantly notified about special offers or perks.
Property owners use Lane’s platform to manage employee handbooks, tenant directories, guest registration, maintenance updates and more. In just a few minutes, building staff can send important communication bulletins to anyone who needs the information. The portal is easy-to-use, customizable and flexible.
Lane’s technology already drives results across 200,000,000 sqft of office spaces across North America. Our current partners include Brookfield, Colliers International, Kipling Group and Hullmark. We’re gearing up for expansion into Boston, NYC, Chicago, D.C., Houston and L.A.
Creating the tools to make every workspace incredible isn’t easy, and the problems we solve are increasingly complex. That’s why our team is quickly becoming a diverse mix of the most intelligent creative problem solvers in the industry.

About
Honest Buildings, a Procore company, is the only project management platform built for owners and managers to ensure capital and construction projects are on time and on budget.
Industry leaders like Brookfield, Beacon Capital Partners, Invesco, The JBG Companies, SL Green, Parkway Properties and Rudin Management use Honest Buildings to streamline project management processes, increase revenue through faster project delivery, reduce project costs and increase efficiencies on projects portfolio-wide.
Commercial and multifamily owners rely on the platform to manage billions of dollars in total project value. Honest Buildings is more than a collaborative, cloud-based technology – it’s a paperless system of record built specifically for, and in partnership with, today’s most innovative real estate owners, project managers and operators.
Using our product to automate new construction and building improvement processes, these companies are unlocking value in data that previously sat unrealized in endless, complicated spreadsheets. Built for real-time insights and designed for any user, Honest Buildings has emerged as the standard for managing existing and developing portfolios across the country, including office, retail, industrial, hospitality and multifamily.

About
We’ve created Homeis because we know first hand how deep the experience of being foreign-born is. When you ask us what home is, we don’t have an easy answer. It’s complicated. We have the city we chose to live in and call home, and then we have our culture, the country we come from, which we call home as well. And it’s a big part of our identity, it’s who we are.
Homeis was created to help people like us, who belong here and there, and feel that the Internet is undeserving them. We’ve witnessed how difficult it is for local foreign-born communities to digitally connect, share their culture, their local knowledge, and unique context. We saw how important these communities are in one’s life, how supportive they can be, and how effective their common wisdom can be to its members.
So we decided it’s time to give foreign-born communities a dedicated comprehensive product. A product that understands them really well, and most importantly – empowers them. It’s what we’re here for. While local culture networks have always existed, our mission is to use technology and innovation to turn these invisible groups into visible communities.
Homeis was founded in Feb 2017 in NYC and Tel Aviv. We’ve launched our first community in Dec 2017, and are planning to open many more in the next months. As most foreign-born people, we are BIG dreamers.

About
Smart sensors are the crucial element of today’s building automation capabilities as they provide the data required for optimizing building operations, energy savings and business intelligence. A critical sensing breakthrough is capturing valuable data on how and where occupants use a building.
Having nearly 30 million consumer electronic devices installed with PointGrab’s Human-Machine Interface (HMI) software, the company has a proven ability to identify and deliver effective solutions on a large scale. Founded by pioneers of ultra-accurate computer vision technologies PointGrab applies its innovative artificial intelligence (deep learning) technology to the building automation ecosystem where real-time occupants’ analytics is lacking. With the advent of its CogniPoint edge-analytics sensing solution PointGrab is fulfilling its mission in making truly intelligent buildings by providing the invaluable data of how and where occupants use the buildings.

About
Building can be much better. The idea for Sustainer Homes came into being on a roof in 2014 when solar panels were laid: new technology must make sustainable building accessible to everyone everywhere. The four founders —Gert van Vugt (CEO), Jacintha Baas (COO), Sol van Kempen (Architect) and Wolf Bierens (CTO) – worked out the idea and after participating in the Startupbootcamp program, the first investor reported the construction of the first prototype.
Sustainer Homes has grown since the first prototype and with the development of the wooden module that makes it possible to build everything from business premises to holiday homes, sustainable construction is becoming accessible to an ever-larger group.

About
The three things that every project requires to be successful are to be within budget, on schedule, and pass quality control. But these goals aren’t always easy to achieve.
Projects can fall behind schedule because managing 10,000 rows of tasks in a spreadsheet or MS Project is hard. And when, as is often the case, the project is managed on a local machine, it’s even harder, resulting in a static Gantt chart even when tasks are added or changed. Budgets increase over time because miscalculations in supplies for a single apartment are magnified hundreds or thousands of times over, and with no connection to Accounting, there’s no oversight. And maintaining quality isn’t easy if quality control procedures aren’t enforced before contractors or subcontractors sign off.
BuilderEdge, the only Salesforce based construction ERP , helps solve these problems by automating scheduling and budget planning, enabling construction project managers to work with templates and entities for easier project creation and maintenance, enforce quality practices, and use real time data to update project status on the fly.

BAVEL – Digital Work Monitor
Software solution to view, manage and control the structured documentation of Construction projects.
Documenting is mandatory in the construction field, without an efficient way of monitoring and documenting the work process information is lost, accidents happens and time table is being delayed.
​
We develop a system that allows construction managers to generate digital data out of their construction site, which makes a big difference.​
​
BAVEL is a digital work monitor.
Our strategic system organizes data according to a professional tagging library.
Although data is inserted by construction managers and other professionals on the site, other members of the staff can participate in document preparation.

About
We know from personal experience how complicated, expensive, and time-consuming it is to find temporary accommodation when moving to a new city for work. Hotels are too expensive for extensive stays and unfurnished apartments are simply impractical.
That’s why we’ve created Homelike. A platform where business travellers and corporates can book furnished apartments with just a few clicks. Searching, requesting, and booking the apartment, as well as payment and signing the lease – the entire process happens online. No need for apartment viewings, or checking multiple websites or newspapers. We have digitised the market for furnished housing and target a seamless experience, outstanding quality, legal certainty and competent service. It is our goal to provide a unique experience for business travelers and corporate travel managers alike, by creating a secure and convenient channel for landlords to market their inventory to corporate tenants. Renting furnished apartments is as simple as booking a hotel room.

About
Innago is a clean, easy to use application for managing your rentals. Our customers are small, independent landlords that have one or two employees, or handle everything themselves. They don’t have a marketing team or an IT department.
From day one, we’ve met and collaborated with these small-to-mid-sized landlords to produce an application they actually want to use. We’ve avoided unnecessary features and focused on saving you time.
Too many property management applications are overwhelming, bloated with features that drive up the cost and turn their software “solution” into a software problem.
If you feel you’ve lost a competitive edge to larger landlords with modern features, or you simply want to streamline your rental management process, you’ve come to the right place.
Our mission is to make renting simple, accessible, and affordable for landlords of any size.

Placer.ai provides retailers with actionable location-based insights into their audience and competition. With unprecedented visibility into humanity-in-action, every retailer can be brilliant at running their business.
Retailers make critical decisions every day whilst in the dark. They do not have answers to seemingly simple questions: Who visits my store? Where do they live, or work? What other locations do they frequent? What’s my churn rate? Where do those lost customers go? What are my competitors up to? And ultimately, how should I deploy my limited resources to grow my business?
Placer.ai provides instant access to location insights derived from the foot traffic of millions of consumers, delivering visibility into offline behavior. We shed light into churn, trade areas, untapped audiences, out-of-store behavior, and competitive benchmarking.

About
We live in an era where brands, of any time, are looking for the ability to understand peoples behaviour in the real world using technology.
Backed Up by Innogy (European Energy Leader) and Nilsen Research
placense is a startup in the field of AI processing and big data analytics. We provide businesses with real-time consumer location data & behavioural insights of the physical world while protecting data privacy of individual providing real-time information about physical foot traffic anywhere in the world. The user inputs an address and instantly gets information that, up to now, was the sole property of the online world, for example: Number of people, Where they came from, Where is home, Method of transportation (Car, Bike, Tram, Truck, Bus etc….), Gender ,Age, Income Level ,Retention (how often to the revisit a location) ,Parking Duration, Do they have kids?, Do they have pets?
This information is gathered using an SDK that can understand the mobility status of the app user (3rd party and brand agnostic apps) without interfering with the apps UX (nor by showing any pop-ups or any other AdTech methods).
This information is all anonymised and aggregated, meeting all EU GDPR regulations.
Recognizing that we are entering the era of Privacy, and the critical, almost make-or-break nature of this aspect in Europe, at Placense we took it upon ourselves to not only comply with GDPR but be innovative trendsetters in this field to stand out from the crowd.
We leverage the fact that unlike mobile data competitors, the value and insights we generate from the data is not personal but rather aggregative, therefore in a user perspective it is non-intrusive and not compromising the sensitive information of each user. Having said that, It is well known that ‘anonymous data’ often isn’t that anonymous. There are a few well-publicized examples of ‘anonymous’ datasets being released that were quickly de-anonymized.

About
We live in an era where brands, of any time, are looking for the ability to understand peoples behaviour in the real world using technology.
Backed Up by Innogy (European Energy Leader) and Nilsen Research
placense is a startup in the field of AI processing and big data analytics. We provide businesses with real-time consumer location data & behavioural insights of the physical world while protecting data privacy of individual providing real-time information about physical foot traffic anywhere in the world. The user inputs an address and instantly gets information that, up to now, was the sole property of the online world, for example: Number of people, Where they came from, Where is home, Method of transportation (Car, Bike, Tram, Truck, Bus etc….), Gender ,Age, Income Level ,Retention (how often to the revisit a location) ,Parking Duration, Do they have kids?, Do they have pets?
This information is gathered using an SDK that can understand the mobility status of the app user (3rd party and brand agnostic apps) without interfering with the apps UX (nor by showing any pop-ups or any other AdTech methods).
This information is all anonymised and aggregated, meeting all EU GDPR regulations.
Recognizing that we are entering the era of Privacy, and the critical, almost make-or-break nature of this aspect in Europe, at Placense we took it upon ourselves to not only comply with GDPR but be innovative trendsetters in this field to stand out from the crowd.
We leverage the fact that unlike mobile data competitors, the value and insights we generate from the data is not personal but rather aggregative, therefore in a user perspective it is non-intrusive and not compromising the sensitive information of each user. Having said that, It is well known that ‘anonymous data’ often isn’t that anonymous. There are a few well-publicized examples of ‘anonymous’ datasets being released that were quickly de-anonymized.

About
Modius® is the leading provider of data center infrastructure management (DCIM) software that enables IT and facilities to work collaboratively to manage all mission critical infrastructure as a single, dynamic system. At Modius, we believe that before you can make intelligent management decisions, you need to have real data on the operational state of your data center, otherwise, you are just guessing that the change you are about to make won’t be catastrophic.
That is why we developed OpenData, an “open”, highly scalable software platform for collecting the unstructured “big data” that comes from all the different makes and models of data center assets, processes, and activities as they are generated in real-time. Real-time data collection is the core foundation for implementing a successful DCIM solution, because real data makes for informed decisions, not sloppy guesswork. At Modius, we make it our business to provide you with the data you need to make better decisions and better manage availability, capacity, and efficiency across your entire data center estate.
Modius OpenData provides solutions for:
– Data Center Infrastructure Management
– Infrastructure Performance Monitoring
– Data Center Capacity Management
– Unified Alarm/Alert Monitoring
– Green IT & Data Center Optimization Initiatives

We know the ins and outs of all building systems, from HVAC to plumbing. We also know that recent growth in building automation technology has created an opportunity for software that helps all of those systems, and the people who manage them, perform better.
With our deep understanding of the parts that make up whole buildings, we’re developing software to securely unlock building data and provide actionable information all while supporting comfortable spaces and increasing operational efficiencies.

You want the dream of ownership without the drawbacks. You want to make expenses predictable, prevent problems from happening, and simplify with one-source for all service needs.
Super is a subscription service that provides care and repair for your home. Super pays for repairs and breakdowns on your covered appliances and home systems. Super’s maintenance schedule helps you understand the needs of your home, with the option of getting us to do it for you. Super’s concierge service manages the logistics for all your home service needs. From your desktop, tablet, or mobile phone, you’re only one tap away from getting the service you need for your home.

About
At Skyline Robotics we believe that humans are more than robots which is why we aim to automate all tasks that are dangerous, dirty and dull. By giving industrial robots senses like sight, hearing, touch and a brain, we are enabling the automation of multiple service sectors.
Starting with window cleaning, we are automating all real estate maintenance work at heights. As buildings grow taller, more complex and valuable, there is an increasing need to ensure that façades are properly maintained. Our robots learn the building, detecting the complex architecture to create the most effective cleaning path.

Our plans are tailored to our members’ individual needs, be it a freelancer who comes in part time or a 20 person team that needs privacy.

About
WHAT IS RATE RESET ? Rate Reset is a feature of a loan that empowers customers to reset their existing auto or mortgage loan electronically. Rate Reset is a simple and easy way to allow customers to lower their monthly auto loan payment and reset the terms of their mortgage without the cost and hassle of refinancing.
HOW DOES IT WORK? The financial institution screens loans that qualify for reset, then notifies the customer of this simple and easy feature. Rate Reset’s software platform provides a turnkey solution of legal documents (e.g. riders, addendums, disclosures, etc.) and marketing collateral for the institution. The member uses their institutions secure website to customize their auto or mortgage loan term, interest rate and monthly payment and review appropriate documents and/or disclosures. If the customer decides to execute the Rate Reset, they simply click the reset button, e-sign the loan document and in a matter of minutes have a lower monthly payment.
BENEFITS TO YOUR INSTITUTION? Rate Reset automates loan retention and eliminates all of the back office cost associated with the traditional auto and Mortgage refinance. Rate Reset Protection built into your auto & mortgage loans provides your institution a competitive advantage in the marketplace. The reset functionality increases retention and the improved member experience increases over-all customer loyalty and stickiness.
BENEFITS TO YOUR CUSTOMER? Rate Reset puts the customer in control of their finances. It allows them to easily extend their auto loan and lower their monthly payment, all without the cost and hassle of refinancing.

About
The platform represents a two-sided marketplace that, on one side, provides hassle-free access to an asset class that was previously inaccessible to individual investors: short-term, real estate backed loans. On the other side of the marketplace, PeerStreet connects a vetted network of private lenders with diverse sources of capital to help fuel their growth and bring lending back to their local communities. The company’s vision is to align the interests of this ecosystem—from lenders and investors to borrowers and the local communities they represent.
PeerStreet was founded to help solve many of the problems in the mortgage finance space that led up to the global economic collapse in 2008, and level the playing field between Wall Street and Main Street. PeerStreet is led by former real estate attorney Brew Johnson, former Google executive Brett Crosby, and Y Combinator alumnus Alex Perelman. Backed by noted venture capital firms including Andreessen Horowitz, PeerStreet was founded in 2013 and has had over $2 billion transacted through the platform as of March 2019.

About
Ownerhood is addressing the residential real-estate market failure in large cities. Buying a property has become a “right” reserved for high net worth individuals. Millennials who actually live in those houses, even the ones earning significantly above average, cannot save enough to buy a house. An entire generation of millennials who want to buy a house, simply cannot afford to. With low supply and high demand – chances of them catching up are slim. Ownerhood’s innovation is simple: by breaking properties into smaller tradable slices Ownerhood removes barriers to homeownership and promotes frictionless access to the residential real-estate market via a simple, digital, crowd driven marketplace.

About
RealAtom is a SaaS-based platform that empowers CRE finance brokers, borrowers and lenders to create more connections and close more deals by streamlining, prioritizing and analyzing loan activities and lender relations on one platform.
We have the experience, technology, and speed to help borrowers, lenders and brokers find the best loan terms and streamline the loan closing process.
RealAtom released in October 2016 and already has over $1.5 billion in loan requests processed. One of our recent loans connected a broker in Virginia representing the developer of a hotel construction project in Chicago with lenders in Los Angeles and Boston.
RealAtom works by a borrower/broker first posting a loan requirement to the platform. Based on parameters such as geography, property type, loan amount, and type, our algorithm then matches the requirement to our proprietary network of over 2,500 lenders. Preliminary term sheets are generated and the negotiation process is coordinated through a custom dashboard for all parties involved. Each remaining step from due diligence to underwriting to closing is optimized within the platform.

About
RealAtom is a SaaS-based platform that empowers CRE finance brokers, borrowers and lenders to create more connections and close more deals by streamlining, prioritizing and analyzing loan activities and lender relations on one platform.
We have the experience, technology, and speed to help borrowers, lenders and brokers find the best loan terms and streamline the loan closing process.
RealAtom released in October 2016 and already has over $1.5 billion in loan requests processed. One of our recent loans connected a broker in Virginia representing the developer of a hotel construction project in Chicago with lenders in Los Angeles and Boston.
RealAtom works by a borrower/broker first posting a loan requirement to the platform. Based on parameters such as geography, property type, loan amount, and type, our algorithm then matches the requirement to our proprietary network of over 2,500 lenders. Preliminary term sheets are generated and the negotiation process is coordinated through a custom dashboard for all parties involved. Each remaining step from due diligence to underwriting to closing is optimized within the platform.

About
Covercy is on a mission to automate the entire process of real estate investment syndications for sponsors (GPs) and their investors (LPs).
50,000+ GPs use spreadsheets to manually manage the investment lifecycle, giving limited visibility to their LPs.
We streamline the fundraising and investor relations processes for small & mid market GPs and their LPs with: digital marketing of opportunities, automatic calling & tracing of capital, holding funds in our conditional payment solution until closing, agreement e-signing, reporting back to investors and distributing capital with preferred returns.
We already process investments worth over $300M per year and serve a fast growing network of 85+ GPs and 2500+ investors.
Covercy has a team of 30 in NYC, Tel Aviv and London, and our partners include FinTech & real estate experts like SGVC & Silvertech Ventures (part of Silverstein Group – owners of World Trade Center).

About
Homeppl offers an innovative solution designed to help renters unlock the best available housing and financial opportunities. The company has developed the Smart Profile, a digital résumé of users’ verified data that can be used in a variety of housing-related situations.
Renters are invited by letting agencies to create their profile, which analyzes, authenticates, and displays their overall credibility and risk. The profile replaces the long and often discriminatory rental check process with a quick, secure, and user-friendly experience. Once complete, the Homeppl Smart Profile can be securely and privately shared with landlords, lenders, and banks.
Homeppl allows applicants to use their rental reputation to access the best available housing opportunities. At the same time, it enables agencies to successfully rent more homes by automating the reference check process. Homeppl’s solution is currently in use in the UK housing sector.

About
Point is the first FinTech platform where homeowners can sell equity in their homes, giving investors access to a new asset class – owner-occupied residential real estate. Historically, the only way a homeowner could unlock the wealth in their home was to take on further debt. Now with an equity investment from Point, they can de-leverage and diversify their wealth so they can invest in their small businesses, make home repairs, pay off debt, or go back to school. Point is the first consumer finance product that is truly aligned with the customer. When the homeowner does well, Point and its investors do well.
We are a well-financed, fast-growing startup backed by top investors like Andreessen Horowitz, located in downtown Palo Alto just minutes from Caltrain.

Nested the estate agent making sellers chain-free. We do this by advancing what you need to buy your new home, whilst we sell your old one for the best possible price.
Selling a home is one of the most stressful things you do in life. It’s all-to-common to experience unclear valuations, broken chains and untrustworthy estate agents. We’re bringing a refreshing approach to this broken industry, removing the uncertainty for home sellers, providing best-in-class service and helping our customers secure their dream home on their timeline.
This is an ambitious goal and it needs an equally ambitious team. Our founders have previously built GoCardless and Songkick, and we’re backed by Europe’s leading VCs and entrepreneurs. Our growth trajectory shows we’re onto something big and we’re looking for exceptional people excited by the prospect of building something that matters to join the team.

About
Redfin got its start inventing map-based search.
Everyone told us the easy money was in running ads for traditional brokers, but we couldn’t stop thinking about how different real estate would be if it were designed from the ground up, using technology and totally different values, to put customers first.
So we joined forces with agents who wanted to be customer advocates, not salesmen.
Since these were our own agents, we could survey each customer on our service and pay a bonus based on the review.
We deepened our technology beyond the initial search to make the home tour, the listing debut, the escrow process, the whole process, faster, easier and worry-free.
And we gave customers more value, not just by saving each thousands in fees, but by investing in every home we sell, by measuring our performance and improving constantly.
This is how real estate would be if it were designed just for consumers, because, well, it was.

About
roOomy’s patented technology paves the way for home furnishings retailers, real estate professionals, and anyone interested in interior design to better visualize their space and products through our ability to convert simple 2D imagery into assets that can be leveraged across 3D, augmented and virtual reality platforms at a scale and efficiency unavailable until now.
Finding a new home and the décor that furnishes it is a big decision. With more prospective buyers and renters using digital applications to help with their decisions, nimble visualization tools are more important than ever before. roOomy’s 3D modeling and rendering capabilities enable home furnishings retailers the ability to showcase their products in 3D/AR/VR settings so that customers can “try before you buy,” and at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. This content, paired with the ease of shopping online, makes roOomy’s digital asset creation capabilities a critical part of each partners’ e- and m-commerce strategies.
Every day, we strive to ensure that our technology creates content that is the next best thing to real life paired with turn-key, scalable, cost-effective services. We’ve grown our modeling and rendering processes and capacity in a way that allows businesses to easily transform not tens, but thousands of products and rooms, in addition to partnering with cutting edge AR technologies, like Apple’s ARKit and Google’s ARCore.

About
At Meetinkz you will find a new space to achieve efficient professional results. In many cases, our existing work environments negatively affect the atmosphere and the character of a meeting and prevent the achievement of our required goals. At the office there are background noises and interruptions, and it is difficult to detach yourself from the day to day tasks and priorities of others. Quite often the size of the space and the furnishings within this space don’t allow flexibility in the seating arrangement and can further hinder productivity.
So we decided to search for a versatile space. We consulted with senior executives, business consultants, and small time start-ups, and eventually understood that there are three criteria that we are all looking for when it comes to a productive meeting space:
A good impression, Inspiration, and enjoyment.
In the dozens of spaces that are at your disposal through Meetinkz, you can create a platform for strategizing and planning in an inspiring and personalized atmosphere. You can present lectures and powerpoints with leading-edge technology, or even hold an annual review in the private room of an award-winning restaurant.

About
Our mission as a secure access company is to transform people’s everyday experiences, starting with the way people interact with sites, structures, and spaces (office lobbies, retail restrooms, and parking structures).
Our first application helps people in urban environments access modern restrooms at retailers. With the Good2Go app, consumers can use their smartphones to find a location, join our virtual queue, and automatically open the restroom door – all while retailers benefit from new foot traffic and revenue.
In every Good2Go launch city, we provide visibility and support to a local nonprofit who shares our commitment to helping our community. In San Francisco, our partner is Lava Mae.

About
LeaseLock helps the world find home. Powered by insurance technology, LeaseLock is reinventing the rental housing transaction—making it faster, simpler, and more affordable.
LeaseLock Zero Deposit™ powers a total elimination of all deposits, bonds, cosigners, and guarantees. Renters pay a fee starting at $19 per month that generates over $5000 in coverage for the property on every lease. Renters save thousands of dollars at move-in, while properties drive more traffic, convert more leases, significantly reduce bad debt, and fully eliminate deposit administration and liability.
LeaseLock is launching across more than 1,000,000 apartment homes, backed by insurance rated A (Excellent) by A.M. Best. LeaseLock secured $10M in Series A financing from leading insurance and real estate technology venture funds including, Liberty Mutual Strategic Ventures, American Family Ventures, Wildcat Venture Partners, and Moderne Ventures.

About
KeyMe is a New York City-based startup that is revolutionizing the way people manage their keys.
The KeyMe platform is a smart, convenient and secure way to copy keys and solve lockouts. We accomplish this using a combination of physical kiosks in leading retailers and mobile apps, which digitally scan your key and save it to the cloud.
Once scanned, you can easily share your key with friends and family via email, and even personalize your key with your favorite sports team or one of our custom designs. If you ever get locked out, simply go to a kiosk and print off a copy using your fingerprint – or go to your local locksmith and have them cut a new key from scratch using instructions provided in the app.

About
EasyKnock provides new ways for homeowners to tap into their equity now. Our two programs, Sell and Stay, and MoveAbility aim to help homeowners live better, by making their equity work for them.
What is Sell and Stay?
Sell and Stay, the first commercialized residential sale leaseback program in the USA, allows homeowners to sell their home, then lease it back. Unique to Sell and Stay, homeowners have the ability to buy back their homes.
What is MoveAbility?
MoveAbility is our sale-leaseback product designed for homeowners planning on moving. MoveAbility enables homeowners to access their home equity before it even hits the market. Now homeowners can access the money and time they deserve to find (and fund) your forever home, without losing out on their current home’s market value.

About
SMART AUTOMATION DELIVERS
BETTER TITLE PRODUCTION
For title professionals, NextAce automation gets orders identified, pre-examined, and ready to complete in as little as 3-5 minutes. This allows you to route up to 80% of orders for expedited processing in under ten minutes, while sending the difficult orders for your traditional examination process. This “triage” creates a faster, more efficient workflow and leaves your most skilled talent focused on orders that require their expertise. Once searched, powerful examination tools increase efficiency and apply your rules consistently, on every order. Layers of added efficiency eliminate manual, repetitive tasks.
In a rapidly evolving industry, we help our partners deliver a modern closing experience that is fast, accurate, and customer-centric. As a patented solution built by and for the title industry, we combine the rigor and due diligence of traditional examination with the speed and efficiency of smart automation.

We believe that people deserve a better real estate experience. That’s why, at Triplemint, we’re putting the power back in the hands of the client, enabling them and empowering them during one of the most important decisions of their lives. Pioneers in the industry, we’re revolutionizing the model to provide more service, deliver more data and offer more inventory than anywhere else.
Led by a team of real estate experts, our innovative, member-centric approach offers greater transparency and unparalleled support, every step of the way. Cutting-edge predictive analytics allow us to anticipate and capitalize on future market activity, and to match prospective buyers and sellers, while next-generation technology ensures an intuitive user experience—all with efficiency and ease.
Whether buying or selling, our clients conduct business on their terms.

About
In 2013 Aaron Levie, CEO of the cloud company Box, tweeted, “Take the stodgiest, oldest, slowest moving industry you can find, and build amazing software for it.”
That’s just what we did . . . years before Aaron said it.
Now in its 19th year, ShowingTime has ultimately automated the scheduling and management of real estate showings across the country, and brought about a new way for agents to share local market data.
We now drive the scheduling and management of nearly 4 million showings each month across the country, and have brought about a new way for more than 950,000 agents to share local market data. This provides convenience to buyers and unprecedented visibility for sellers.

About
Founded in 2014, Sweet Inn (www.sweetinn.com) is an international, next generation travel-tech startup disrupting the traditional hospitality industry.
Going far beyond traditional home-sharing, the company’s innovative business model takes long terms leases on apartments, transforms them into stylish and upscale ‘smart’ apartments with a full range of personalized services to accommodate tourists and business travelers worldwide.
Sweet Inn chose to develop its own proprietary technology to have the complete control and flexibility to innovate its operations and guests’ experiences, optimize and automate task management, communications and resource allocation.
Dedicated local teams operate from central City Lobbies, and a mobile App allows travelers to reach a team member anytime via chat, order personalized services, and view local tips tailored to their apartment location.
As both the leaseholder and exclusive property manager, Sweet Inn entrusts in-house interior designers with the unique decor of each apartment, customized to reflect the vibe of its neighborhood.
Within just four years of its launch, Sweet Inn is now operating in 13 exciting cities (Paris, London, Dublin, Barcelona, Madrid, Seville, Rome, Milan, Brussels, Lisbon, Juan-les-Pins, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem), offering travelers over 600 upscale apartments to choose from, and plan to double this number by the end of 2019.

Imagine your dream house. How would you describe it? Does natural light flow in through skylights and french doors? Are the streets lined with trees?
A good Realtor learns what you’re looking for and suggests homes based on his or her intimate understanding of the inventory in a particular neighborhood. Ironically, the way people describe the home they’re searching for is incompatible with today’s real estate search portals. RealScout is laying the foundation for a more personal home search.

About
Apartment booking for businesses.
Whether you’re expecting managers, trainees, executives, or teams
we’ll find them the perfect apartment accommodation.
It’s no wonder that so many travel coordinators write off the idea of booking an apartment before they even start.
It should be straightforward and simple as booking a hotel, but it’s usually one big hassle. It can take you hours or sometimes days to work out if the location is good enough if the host is friendly, and if the apartment is clean.
OneAgent created a solution that unlocks apartment booking for travel coordinators and accommodation bookers. A full, inclusive service that enables you to book professional apartments quickly and painlessly, while keeping your guests happy and saving you up to 50% of your budget.

About
All around the world, home buyers are making the biggest purchase of their life with no ability to understand their options and the tradeoffs between them.
We believe it’s the biggest consumer problem — and with a unique team of leading Data Scientists, Software Engineers, Urban Planners, Cartographers, Designers and Copywriters, we’re solving it.
Localize.city (known as Madlan in Israel) is a home search platform. We reveal the full story of every address on the market in NYC. We’ve successfully changed how Israelis find their next home. With a fresh round of funding we’ve brought our technology, methods, and experience to the United States.
Our leadership team are seasoned leaders and serial entrepreneurs with extensive experience building products and services on a global scale. We led algorithm and software development at Taboola (the world’s leading recommendation engine) and Trusteer (acquired by IBM for $700M), led the map design for Waze (acquired by Google for $1b), and strategy at Twitter.

About
Founded in August of 2008 and based in San Francisco, California, Airbnb is a trusted community marketplace for people to list, discover, and book unique accommodations around the world — online or from a mobile phone. Whether an apartment for a night, a castle for a week, or a villa for a month, Airbnb connects people to unique travel experiences, at any price point, in more than 33,000 cities and 192 countries. And with world-class customer service and a growing community of users, Airbnb is the easiest way for people to monetize their extra space and showcase it to an audience of millions.
No global movement springs from individuals. It takes an entire team united behind something big. Together, we work hard, we laugh a lot, we brainstorm nonstop, we use hundreds of Post-Its a week, and we give the best high-fives in town. Headquartered in San Francisco, we have satellite offices in Dublin, London, Barcelona, Paris, Milan, Copenhagen, Berlin, Moscow, São Paulo, Sydney, and Singapore.

About
Snapdocs powers homeownership. Using technology, we’re building the connective tissue for an entire pillar of the U.S. economy: residential real estate.
Today, we’re working to perfect mortgage closings, but that’s only the beginning. If we succeed, more than five million families per year will gain clarity and transparency as they make the biggest financial decision of their lives: buying a home.
Before Snapdocs, no one felt responsible or empowered to solve the problems we face every day we come to the office. It’s complex and difficult work, and the result is not an app we brag about at tech industry parties. Instead, we’re making a difference and carefully building a team that shares our priorities—pragmatism, respect and empathy for our clients, and building honest products that improve all our users’ lives.

About
In 2011 SkySlope started out in the third bedroom of our CEO’s house with just him and two others. Every year since then we’ve experienced insane growth and after growing out of our previous 3 offices we have now settled into our new home in downtown Sacramento only two blocks away from the new arena and right in the heart of the action. The team has now grown from the original 3 to over 150 and our new space allows for us to aggressively move towards our goal of being 200 strong by the end of 2019.
By the power of an amazing product and tons of Red Bull we now have over 160,000 users spread out across 5000 offices nationwide. We’ve been successful because we obsess over building cutting edge software that makes the Real Estate world a better place. 8 out of the top 15 Real Estate Brokerages in the nation are currently using software in order to be paperless and all 8 of them use our product. But, despite being happy with what we’ve achieved we know that as industry leaders in our space there’s a lot of work left to be done. Because of that, in October 2017 we announced that SkySlope will become a part of the Fidelity National Financial (NYSE: FNF) family. This partnership will allow us to not only grow faster than we ever have before, but it will also allow us to build exciting new products for our customers while maintaining the same broker and agent-centric approach that we’ve become known for over the years.

About
When it comes to selling a home, how do you choose the best real estate agent? Most people ask their friends for recommendations, others try to gather data online. Some even resort to looking at mail drops and posters on the street to find local agents. But how do you know if you’re hiring a top agent for the job?
OpenAgent is solving this problem by working actively to change the way property is transacted, and helping thousands of people every month to improve their experience in real estate.
We do this by making personalised recommendations based on past sales expertise and thousands of customer reviews. We analyse every agent in Australia and over 1 million transactions to match vendors with top agents in their suburb who are most qualified to sell their property.
We bring more information, better insight and an independent voice to the property transaction, helping people sell smarter, better and faster every single day.

About
Baya Build uses a new method of construction that integrates technology innovation to produce high performance structures (hurricane, earthquake, flood and fire) at a significantly cheaper cost and in a fraction of the time.
Our current target market is low to middle income homes, medical clinics and multi-purpose disaster rebuild.
Interconnecting building components combined with machine intelligence streamline home construction in low income to luxury markets reducing 60% of construction costs.
A nearly infinite number of configurations, sizes, layouts, finishes, utilities and interconnecting components are designed to click together.
Key Advantages:
– Baya builds in days not months or years
– Saves money: over 60%
– Low income to luxury

Problem:
Traditional construction has multiple challenges manifested by its inherent inefficiencies of builders and their co-dependencies. Workers, conflicts of time, schedules and unaligned interests are only some of the contributing factors to delays and mistakes leading to excessive costs and overruns.
Solution:

The solution is all encompassing – starting at the design stage, continuing through assembly and ending with a finished product.
Product:
Baya’s building system enables developers to design, decorate, order and build homes and structures at a fraction of time and cost without compromising quality, integrity, design and/or functionality.
The company introduces a revolutionary approach to structural design, deployment and assembly of homes, condos and multi-purpose structures.
Benefits:
Decreased design costs
Pre-cut building components (zero waste)
No construction = quick assembly

About
GeoSim is the developer of an end-to-end city-modeling system that provides exceptional street-level detail. Utilizing more than three million lines of software code and a scalable production methodology, GeoSim achieves a 10x speedup over traditional techniques. The company’s city models can be freely navigated, just like a video game.
GeoSim’s 3D city models allow individual 3D objects (e.g. building features, traffic lights, parking meters, trees, etc.) to be searched, counted, and linked to dynamic information about their states. Streaming data, such as IoT sensor outputs, can be visualized in real time, enabling new ways of viewing and understanding relationships among multiple data sets.

Since then, we’ve helped hundreds of people buy homes with a truly seamless process. We’ve broken down each step of the journey and systematically reshaped it with comprehensive consumer education, segmented expertise, financial innovation, and on-demand technology. And we’re just getting started.
